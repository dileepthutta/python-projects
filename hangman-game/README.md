**Hangman** is a classic word-guessing game where the player attempts to figure out a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time.

* The player starts with **6 lives**.
* For each **correct guess**, the player's lives remain unchanged.
* For each **incorrect guess**, the player loses **1 life**.
* The game continues until the player either:

  * **Guesses the full word correctly** (they win), or
  * **Runs out of lives** (they lose).

An **ASCII art** representation of a hangman is displayed, updating with each wrong guess. As the player makes mistakes, the ASCII figure progresses toward a “dead” state. If the player guesses correctly, the art remains the same.
